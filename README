This is tolua++-1.0

* What is tolua++?
  tolua++ is an extension of toLua, a tool to integrate C/C++ code with
  Lua. tolua++ includes new features oriented to c++, such as class
  templates.

  tolua is a tool that greatly simplifies the integration of C/C++ code 
  with Lua. Based on a "cleaned" header file, tolua automatically generates 
  the binding code to access C/C++ features from Lua. Using Lua-5.0 API and
  metamethod facilities, the current version automatically maps C/C++ 
  constants, external variables, functions, namespace, classes, and methods 
  to Lua. It also provides facilities to create Lua modules.

# Setup

### Python

* Install Python (currently using 3.11)
  * Get `pip` if necessary: `py -m ensurepip --upgrade`
  * Update `pip` if necessary: `python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip`
* Install [Cygwin](https://sourceware.org/cygwin/)
  * During installation, you will need packages `gcc-core` and `make`
* Install [SCons](https://github.com/SCons/scons)
  * In this directory, run `setup install`
  * Add the `scripts/` directory to environment variables, if necessary, to run the `scons.bat` command

### Autobuild tolua++

* Build in Cygwin with `autobuild.sh`
  * May need to modify `lua/luaconf.h` to set LUA_32BITS as `1`
  * May need to run `scons.bat --clean` and try again.
    * Clean may delete `toluabind.c`, so revert that if necessary.

### Manually Build tolua++ (optional)

* Download [Lua](https://www.lua.org/ftp/) (currently using 5.4.6)
  * Extract to `lua/`
  * Build Lua in Cygwin with `cd lua && make mingw`
    * May need to modify `lua/luaconf.h` to set LUA_32BITS as `1`
* Build tolua++ in Cygwn with `scons.bat`
